# House of Games App

## Hosted Version
https://gameview-licorice.netlify.app/

## Background
House of Games is a board games content rating and discussion website.
Game reviews are divided into categories. Each review has user curated ratings and can be up or down voted. Logged in users can also add comments about a review.

The intention of this front-end architecture is to visualise the previously built back-end API - accessible [here](https://gameview.onrender.com), consolidating the understanding of making a [C.R.U.D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) application from a front end perspective.
